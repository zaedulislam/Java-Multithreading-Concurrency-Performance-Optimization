## Coding Exercise 1: Thread Creation - MultiExecutor

### Problem Statement

In this exercise, we are going to implement a `MultiExecutor`.

The client of this class will create a list of `Runnable` tasks and provide that list into `MultiExecutor`'s constructor.

When the client runs the `executeAll()`, the `MultiExecutor` will execute all the given tasks.

To take full advantage of our multicore CPU, we would like the `MultiExecutor` to execute all the tasks in parallel by passing each task to a different thread.

Please implement the `MultiExecutor` below.


```java
public class MultiExecutor {

    // Add any necessary member variables here

    /*
     * @param tasks to executed concurrently
     */
    public MultiExecutor(List<Runnable> tasks) {
        // Complete your code here
    }

    /**
     * Starts and executes all the tasks concurrently
     */
    public void executeAll() {
        // complete your code here
    }
}
```

### Solution

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;


public class MultiExecutor {

    private final List<Runnable> tasks;

    /*
     * @param tasks to executed concurrently
     */
    public MultiExecutor(List<Runnable> tasks) {
        this.tasks = tasks;
    }

    /**
     * Starts and executes all the tasks concurrently
     */
    public void executeAll() {
        List<Thread> threads = new ArrayList<>(tasks.size());

        for (Runnable task : tasks) {
            Thread thread = new Thread(task);
            threads.add(thread);
        }

        for (Thread thread : threads) {
            thread.start();
        }
    }
}
```
